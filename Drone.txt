Construct a Drone
         Unmanned aerial vehicles have been around for decades, but they have achieved the greatest popularity in recent years with small commercial drones. The new so-called FPV (first person view) technology gave us a unique experience of flying and the advancement of GPS systems in drones opened a whole new world for passionate individuals.
          Drones are not the only RC flying devices on the market, but their agile multi-rotors and their capability to take amazing photos and record stunning videos during flight made them the most popular. That’s why commercial drones are in great demand nowadays. Today, there is a wide range of drones on the market, and they differ in size, design, and properties. You just need to visit some popular online stores, where the drones are being sold, and find some ready to use a model that best suits you according to its features and price. However, the real challenge is to construct a drone from scratch without using a special kit. You would have to find the necessary pieces and imagine the drone structure yourself. That’s  what I starts this drone project to enjoy my self. I will start this project on 01th August 2018.
